## Overview

This repository contains tools for visualizing Weather Research and Forecasting Data Assimilation(WRFDA) model output data. The tools are designed to help meteorologists and researchers analyze and present WRF simulation results effectively.

## Core

Most of the code are from leaflet-vector-scalar-js but I have modified the main method of data acquisition.
